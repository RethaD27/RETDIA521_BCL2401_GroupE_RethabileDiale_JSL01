## Pet Adoption Validation
This project is a simple web-based tool designed to validate pet adoption syntax.

## Introduction:
The Pet Adoption Syntax Validator allows SPCA volunteers to quickly verify the syntax of pet adoption codes. Pet adoption codes must adhere to a specific format which is to start with "pet_" followed by the pet's birth year and name.

## Usage:
*Input the pet adoption code into the provided text field.
*Click the "Validate" button to verify the syntax of the input.
*If the syntax is valid, a green circle will appear, and if there's an error, a red circle will be displayed.

## Tech Languages:
*HTML
*CSS
